# How It Works:

1. Index Page: Creates showing of SQL items (Base set is 10, unless added to). All item buttons lead to details page about item. Also allows to add new items from the nav menu, but the other options are gray'd out.
2. Detail Page: Showcases more information about the Hat. Also unlocks the features of edit and delete. These allow customization if specific hat info.
3. Create Page: Allows user to enter information for new hat (Name, Year, Price, Bio, Details, and Pic), then upload it to the SQL database. The new hat will then showcase on index page.
4. Edit Page: Allow user to modify existing information about specific item, such as the name, bio, details, etc.
5. Delete Page: Allow user to delete existing item from the SQL database.
6. Login Page: Allows users to enter their Usernames and Passwords to log into their account, granting more access to the webpage.
