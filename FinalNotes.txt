Final Steps:

1. Transition data from JSON to SQL and have page print data from database (Use PDO to access data on WebPage))
2. Add Login/Signup feature that uses the SQL database to track user info
3. Develop Pages for Users/Admins/Public that differs from each other
4. Admins will be given the pages for CRUD, but no others will see these options (index, details, create, edit, delete)
5. Members will be given the pages to view the content (index, details)
6. Public will be given the pages to view the content (index)

Notes:
1. Do not use "die" or "print_r" statements
2. Don't forget to do a presentation video
3. Download and link the SQL file into the GitHub
